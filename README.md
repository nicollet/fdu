# fdu
fast cache for du

It is just a pet project converted from an old ruby library.

Anyway, it can be usefull if you want to remember which directories take space.

It was initially written for a backup server, but it can be used anywhere.

Just type: fdu.py *
and next time you will launch this command everything will be ultra-fast !

To cache disk usage, fdu stores a .SIZE file on everydirectory.

If you want to upgrade its cache, simply do a fdu.py --update.

Note again that this is just a pet project, barely tested.

Enjoy,
